# Sentiment-Analysis-on-ChatGPT-Tweets-Using-Pyspark
This PySpark project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets related to the ChatGPT language model. The dataset was scraped from Twitter and contains tweets with the hashtag #chatgpt. The sentiment analysis is performed using the Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities of PySpark. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned before applying a machine learning model to classify each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains a collection of tweets with the hashtag #chatgpt.You can download the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tariqsays/chatgpt-twitter-dataset

## Requirements 
To run the project, you will need to have the following software and libraries installed: 
- PySpark 
- Jupyter Notebook/ Google Collab
- Pandas 
- Numpy


## Conclusion
This project demonstrated how to use PySpark for data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and visualization. We used PySpark to clean and preprocess the Twitter dataset containing tweets with the hashtag #ChatGPT. Then, we applied a sentiment analysis technique to classify the tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. Finally, we visualized the sentiment analysis results using a bar chart. PySpark provides a powerful and scalable way to process large datasets, making it an ideal tool for big data projects. With PySpark, we can easily distribute the processing of data across a cluster of machines, enabling us to process data faster and more efficiently. Additionally, PySpark comes with built-in support for many machine learning and data analysis libraries, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of data-related tasks. Overall, this project demonstrated the capabilities of PySpark for data processing and analysis, and showcased how it can be used to gain insights from large datasets.
